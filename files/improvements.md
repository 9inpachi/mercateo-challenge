# Task 1

The items marked checked have been implemented for the challenge.

## What will I do different?

[x] Have an add (+) icon on the input to add a task
[ ] Make use of icons where possible (like icons next to `All`, `Active` and `Completed`)
[x] Use an edit icon as a second choice for editing a task (not just through double click)
[x] Configure a more modular build

## What's good?

* The minimal UI design
* Application stability (minimum bugs)

## What's bad?

[x] Line-through for completed tasks which could change the meaning to not done / skipped
[ ] Some types are missing in code
[x] Deprecated usage of refs
[x] Build files are in the same folder as source files
[ ] App responsive in design but not usable on mobile devices
